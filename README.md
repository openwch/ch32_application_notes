# Introduction

[中文](README_zh.md) | English

This series of AN (Application Note) manuals focuses on the ***main function applications*** and ***implementation in typical*** scenarios of the CH32 series MCUs. It fills the detailed gaps in chip datasheets regarding "how to use functions and how to solve problems", while avoiding the overly macroscopic nature of reference manuals. Directly addressing the high-frequency technical needs that developers encounter in practical development, it provides reusable and verifiable solutions to shorten the project R&D cycle.

## Usage Recommendations

* It is recommended to read this AN manual together with the CH32 chip's datasheet (for understanding pin definitions and electrical parameters) and reference manual (for understanding the structure of peripheral registers) to form a comprehensive technical understanding.
* Developers can quickly search for the required manual through the Excel spreadsheet in the repository based on project needs (e.g., "Low-Power Application Note", "CH32H417 DMA Performance Analysis").
* If you encounter technical questions or find content omissions during use, you can submit feedback via the Issue function of the repository, or post a request for help on the [WCH Official Forum](https://www.wch.cn/bbs/forum-106-1.html). We will be dedicated to providing you with answers.
